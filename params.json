{"name":"Nexus-crowd-plugin","body":"### Welcome to Nexus-crowd-plugin.\r\nThis fork is to keep an up to date version of the nexus-crowd-plugin. With so many updates both on the nexus and crowd front, it's hard to keep track! And those two awesome products work so well together....\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n1. Add a `nexus` application to Crowd with a `SECRET` secret\r\n\r\n1. Create a file called `crowd-plugin.xml` under `sonatype-work/nexus/conf`\r\n\r\n> \r\n`<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<crowdConfiguration>\r\n  <crowdServerUrl>http://[crowdhost]:[crowdport]/crowd/services/</crowdServerUrl>\r\n  <applicationName>nexus</applicationName>\r\n  <applicationPassword>SECRET</applicationPassword>\r\n  <useGroups>true</useGroups>\r\n</crowdConfiguration>`\r\n\r\n1. unzip the bundle under `sonatype-work/nexus/plugin-repository`\r\n\r\n1. Start Nexus and use the Administration->Server panel to add `OSS Crowd Authentication Realm` to the list of active realms.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Plugin Download\r\n[nexus-crowd-plugin-2.0.4-bundle.zip](https://github.com/downloads/PatrickRoumanoff/nexus-crowd-plugin/nexus-crowd-plugin-2.0.4-bundle.zip) is the second release for Nexus 2.0.4 and Crowd 2.4.0 - This one is actually working for both Authentication and Authorisation.\r\n\r\n### Plan for next iterations\r\n* use the REST API\r\n* use a properties file (instead of XML)\r\n* enable a group filter\r\n* provide a configuration UI\r\n* enable Single Sign On (SSO)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@PatrickRoumanoff based on initial work by @justinedelson from @sonatype\r\n","tagline":"This is a fork from sonatype/nexus-crowd-plugin to support up to date versions of nexus and crowd","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
